Often the client has many competing objectives and constraints that must be properly balanced. The analyst's goal is to uncover important factors, at the beginning, that can influence the outcome of the project. A possible consequence of neglecting this step is to expend a great deal of effort producing the right answers to the wrong questions.\n","\n","### output\n","\n","#### background\n","\n","Record the information that is known about the organization's business situation at the beginning of the project.\n","\n","#### business objectives \n","\n","Describe the customer's primary objective, from a business perspective. In addition to the primary business objective, there are typically other related business questions that the customer would like to address. For example, the primary business goal might be to keep current customers by predicting when they are prone to move to a competitor. Examples of related business questions are \"How does the primary channel (e.g., ATM, visit branch, internet) a bank customer uses affect whether they stay or go?\" or \"Will lower ATM fees significantly reduce the number of high-value customers who leave?\"\n","\n","#### business success criteria \n","\n","Describe the criteria for a successful or useful outcome to the project from the business point of view. This might be quite specific and able to be measured objectively, such as reduction of customer churn to a certain level or general and subjective such as \"give useful insights into the relationships.\" In the latter case it should be indicated who makes the subjective judgment.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### ANSWER\n","\n","#### Background\n","Retail store sells various goods from different countries to customers.\n","\n","#### Business Objectives\n","Primary Objective: Increase the income of the store.  \n","Related Business Question: What is the customer segmentation?\n","\n","#### Business Success Criteria\n","The income is increased."],"metadata":{"id":"iF1vj30lmvwh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"AZCQA0YfF1Yq"},"source":["## assess situation\n","-------------\n","\n","### task\n","\n","This task involves more detailed fact-finding about all of the resources,constraints, assumptions and other factors that should be considered in determining the data analysis goal and project plan.

Mark results of these analyses explicitly in the project plan, ideally with actions and recommendations if the risks appear.\n","\n","Note: the project plan contains detailed plans for each phase. For example, decide at this point which evaluation strategy will be used in the evaluation phase. The project plan is a dynamic document in the sense that at the end of each phase a review of progress and achievements is necessary and an update of the project plan accordingly is recommended. Specific review points for these reviews are part of the project plan, too.\n","\n","#### initial assessment of tools and techniques\n","\n","At the end of the first phase, the project also performs an initial assessment of tools and techniques.
